# My dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles that I use. These aren't very "snazzy" by any
means, but they are all my own, and there's something to say about that :)

My vimrc is pretty slim & pretty much only includes quality of life improvements
as opposed to implementing new features.

My bashrc is full of aliases to particular directories that I work with and
functions that make my life easier when working with clearcase
